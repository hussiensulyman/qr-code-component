## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox property much effectively and use the CSS variables.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
* {
  --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}

.content{
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  align-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to learn and practice more and more specially with Javascript to be more professional in front-end development.
